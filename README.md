# Face Recognition and Comparison Model

This repository contains Python code for a Face Recognition and Comparison model using OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition libraries. The model can detect faces in images, compare two detected faces, and provide a similarity score based on facial landmarks and face embeddings.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- dlib
- numpy
- face_recognition
- pathlib

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib numpy face_recognition
```

Additionally, the model requires the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file, which contains the pre-trained facial landmark detector from dlib. Download the file from the following link and place it inside the 'Models' directory:

[shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-model.git
cd face-recognition-model
```

2. Place the images you want to compare in the 'Test_Images' directory.

3. Open the `compare_faces.py` script and modify the `image_path1` and `image_path2` variables to specify the paths of the images you want to compare.

4. Run the `compare_faces.py` script:

```bash 
python compare_faces.py
```
5. The script will process the images, detect faces, compare them using facial landmarks and face embeddings, and display the similarity score along with visualizations of the detected faces.

## Model Deployment

To deploy the Face Recognition and Comparison model in a production environment, you can consider the following steps:

1. **Create a Web Application**: Develop a web application using a framework like Flask or Django. This application will serve as the frontend for users to upload images and see the comparison results.

2. **Set up a Web Server**: Deploy your web application on a web server like Nginx or Apache to make it accessible over the internet.

3. **Server-Side Script**: Adapt the provided Python script (`compare_faces.py`) to work as an API endpoint within your web application. This script will handle image processing, face detection, and comparison.

4. **Input Validation**: Implement input validation in the API to ensure that users are providing valid image files for comparison.

5. **Security Considerations**: Consider security measures like image privacy, user authentication, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.

6. **Scaling**: If needed, ensure that your deployment can handle multiple concurrent requests by scaling your web server and backend services.

7. **Frontend Development**: Design a user-friendly frontend where users can upload images and view the comparison results.

8. **Optimization**: Optimize the model and code for faster processing. You may also consider using GPU acceleration for better performance.

9. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling and logging to detect and handle issues in production.

10. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your application under various scenarios to ensure it functions as expected.

11. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation on how to use the web application, including any APIs or endpoints available.

Remember to comply with data protection regulations and ensure that you have proper consent from users if you are collecting or processing their images.
